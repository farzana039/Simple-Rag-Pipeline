# Simple-Rag-Pipeline
This project is a beginner-friendly tutorial project for building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It demonstrates how to index documents, retrieve relevant content, generate AI-powered responses, and evaluate resultsâ€”all through a command line interface (CLI).
The RAG Framework lets you to:

Index Documents: Process and break documents (e.g., PDFs) into smaller, manageable chunks.
Store & Retrieve Information: Save document embeddings in a vector database (using LanceDB) and search using similarity.
Generate Responses: Use an AI model (via the OpenAI API) to provide concise answers based on the retrieved context.
Evaluate Responses: Compare the generated response against expected answers and view the reasoning behind the evaluation.
